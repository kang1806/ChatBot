- - Ei, what show were you watching?
  - Nothing really, just some reality TV show...
  - About what?
  - I dunno, it was just this show about a girl who gets pregnant when she's only 17. They follow her around for a while when she's pregnant and then afterwards when she has the baby.
  - Sounds kind of interesting. 
  - Yup quite interesting.
  - What did you think of it? Was it realistic?
  - Well, she definitely had a lot of problems.
  - Ya ah, example?
  - Like when she was pregnant she couldn't do all the stuff that her friends were doing and had to miss out on thigs like going on the class trip at the end of the year which sucked for her.
  - what about after the baby arrived?  
  - Well she didn't really have a good place to stay. Her parents were really mad at her so they kicked her out and she was staying at her boufriend's, but he was a real jerk. I can't believe that her parents were so mean that they would actually kick her out of the house. I mean she made a mistake, but that seems beyond mean.
  - From parent perspective maybe they think this is the only way she can learn a lesson.
  - So you will kick me out if i get baby when in high school?
  - I don't think i would ever kick you out of the house, but i certainl wouldn't be very happpy if you told me that you were pregnant.
